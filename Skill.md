# SEO Utils MCP Tool Selection Guide

When the user asks about SEO data, use this guide to pick the correct tool.

## Rule 1: Local Data vs API Data

The user has TWO types of SEO data:

**Local database** (synced/tracked over time) — use `query_database` or `query_gsc`:
- Organic Rank Tracker reports → `organic_rank_tracker_*` tables. Ranked-page capture metadata is in `organic_rank_tracker_page_html_captures`, but the HTML body is stored on disk; discover two completed capture IDs with `query_database`, then use `compare_ranked_page_html` to read and diff them
- Google Business Rank Tracker → `google_business_rank_tracker_*` tables
- Review Fetcher (Google Business reviews) → `google_business_review_fetches`, `google_business_review_snapshots`, and the GLOBAL deduplicated `google_business_reviews` table — review rows are SHARED across businesses, so NEVER filter it alone; always JOIN through `google_business_review_snapshot_reviews` against the business's latest completed snapshot and exclude `visibility_status = 'missing'`
- Google Search Console data → `search_console_*` tables (use `query_gsc`)
- LLM Rank Tracker → `llm_rank_tracker_*` tables
- Content Struct outlines → `content_struct*` tables
- SERP Clustering → `serp_clustering_reports` + `serp_clustering_keywords` (parent_id = own id AND intersection_count NOT NULL → cluster parent; parent_id = 0 → unclustered orphan; else child of parent_id) + `serp_items` for the SERP URLs behind each keyword (filter to MAX(updated_at) per unique_id). WORD-ORDER TWIN FORK: a row with `serp_source_keyword_id` NOT NULL reused its twin's SERP (run with `reuse_word_order_twins=true`) — no SERP was bought for it, its own `serp_item_unique_id` rows in `serp_items` are NOT its results (never read its ranks/URLs through them), and its stored `intersection_count` describes the twin. Read clusters with the SQL the clustering tools print (it NULLs that count and names the twin in `serp_reused_from`); join `serp_items` only for rows where `serp_source_keyword_id IS NULL`
- NLP Analysis → `nlp_analysis_*` tables
- NAP Finder → `nap_finder_*` tables
- Saved Keywords → `saved_keywords_*` tables
- Automations → `automations`, `automation_*` tables
- Indexing status → `site_urls`, `index_now_urls` tables
- Log Analysis → `log_analysis_reports`, `log_file_analysis_*` tables, per-report `log_sources` (auto-import config), per-hit `log_file_analysis_ai_requests` (AI answer/assistant bots, 90d retention), and the GLOBAL `bot_categories` lookup (bot → bucket: ai_answer / ai_assistant / ai_training / search / social / seo_tool / monitoring / other). For upgraded reports (`log_analysis_reports.bucket_schema_version >= 1`), `log_file_analysis_page_activities` has denormalized `ai_answer_hits` / `ai_assistant_hits` / `ai_training_hits` / `search_hits` / `other_bot_hits` columns; for pre-upgrade reports those are 0 and you must parse `bot_hits` JSON + JOIN `bot_categories`.
- SEO Tests → `tests`, `test_*` tables

**DataForSEO API** (on-demand, third-party estimates) — use action tools:
- `get_keyword_suggestions` / `get_bing_related_keywords` — keyword research. `get_keyword_suggestions` takes an optional `source`: `labs` (database, cheapest) or `google_ads` (live Google Ads). Omitted = the installation default when it is one of those two, else `labs`; the other metric sources are refused because they cannot discover keywords
- `get_organic_keywords` — what keywords a domain ranks for (estimated)
- `get_traffic_summary` / `get_historical_rank` — traffic estimates
- `get_traffic_competitors` / `get_top_pages` — competitor/page analysis
- `fetch_backlinks` / `get_backlink_summary` / etc. — backlink data
- `bulk_traffic_analysis` / `bulk_backlink_analysis` — multi-domain comparison
- `check_keyword_metrics` — search volume, KD, CPC. Optional `source` picks the data source (empty = the default set in SEO Utils); results land in `keyword_metrics`, tagged in its `source` column
- `fetch_serp_data` — live SERP results

## Rule 2: Common Mistakes to Avoid

| User says | WRONG tool | CORRECT approach |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| "rank tracker report" or "my rankings" | `get_organic_keywords` | `query_database` on `organic_rank_tracker_*` tables |
| "what changed on this ranked page?", "why did this page become lost/new?", or "compare the captured HTML" | `query_database` alone (it can only see capture metadata/file paths, not the HTML body) or `fetch_serp_data` (SERP HTML is not ranked-page HTML) | Use `query_database` to select two completed `organic_rank_tracker_page_html_captures`, then `compare_ranked_page_html`. Start with `content_mode=main_content`; use `full_html` for title/canonical/robots/structured-data/template checks. Prefer equal `page_key` for before/after; different page keys are only an explicit lost-page vs replacement-page comparison. Treat changes as correlated evidence, not proof of ranking causation |
| "add keywords to my rank tracker" or "start tracking X for example.com" | `add_keywords_to_list` (saved-keywords tool) or `query_database` (SQL is read-only, can't INSERT) | `add_organic_rank_tracker_keywords` — then ASK the user whether to `run_rank_tracker` as a follow-up (don't auto-rerun). Saved keyword lists are a separate feature |
| "remove keywords from my rank tracker" or "delete X from my rank tracker" or "clean up keywords in <report>" | `remove_keywords_from_list` (saved-keywords tool, wrong feature) or `query_database` (SQL is read-only, can't DELETE) | `remove_organic_rank_tracker_keywords` — match is by keyword text. DESTRUCTIVE: also deletes historical positions, PAA appearances, and insights for those keywords. Confirm with the user before running on a large set |
| "delete my GMB report(s)", "remove these local rank trackers / grids", or "clean up my GMB test reports" | `delete_gmb_report_group` (deletes only the GROUP — its reports stay) or `query_database` (SQL is read-only, can't DELETE) | `delete_gmb_rank_tracker_reports` with `report_ids` (whole-number IDs from `google_business_rank_tracker_reports`, max 100 per call; one report = one-item list). DESTRUCTIVE and permanent: also deletes the reports' keywords, grid markers, snapshots and ranking history — confirm the report names and IDs with the user first. Deleting reports does not delete a group that contained them |
| "search volume is 0 / missing but Keyword Planner shows numbers" or "get Google Ads volume for these keywords" | `check_keyword_metrics` with no `source` (repeats the default, usually `labs`, whose database omits many keywords) | `check_keyword_metrics` with `source='google_ads'` (or `dfs_search_volume`) — both need the user's own DataForSEO credentials and cost more, so confirm first. A re-check replaces the keyword's figures AND monthly history with the new source's. When reading `keyword_metrics`: `search_volume IS NULL` = checked but the source had no figure ("no data"); `0` = the source reported zero searches — never report NULL as 0 |
| "keyword ideas / suggestions from Google Ads", "Keyword Planner ideas for X", or "suggestions are empty / the database has no data for this niche keyword" | `get_keyword_suggestions` with no `source` (usually `labs`, which misses many niche keywords) followed by `check_keyword_metrics` on the whole list (a second paid call per keyword batch) | `get_keyword_suggestions` with `source='google_ads'` — one search returns live Google Ads volume/CPC/competition for the seed AND every idea (~$0.10 per search vs ~$0.012 for `labs`; billed to the user's own DataForSEO credentials, so confirm first). The ideas carry NO keyword difficulty, search intent, backlink or SERP-results figures: `kd_from`/`kd_to`/`search_intents` filters are refused in this mode, and sorting by difficulty falls back to volume. The figures are also saved to `keyword_metrics` with `source = 'google_ads'` |
| "keyword cannibalization" | `get_organic_keywords` | `query_database` on `search_console_query_pages` |
| "trending queries" or "GSC data" | `get_organic_keywords` | `query_gsc` on `search_console_queries` |
| "my backlink history" | `fetch_backlinks` | Could be either — ask if they mean tracked data or fresh API data |
| "optimization opportunities" | `get_organic_keywords` | `query_database` on `search_console_query_pages` + `search_console_query_page_mentions` |
| "weak pages" or "low CTR pages" | `get_organic_keywords` | `query_gsc` on `search_console_pages` or `search_console_queries` |
| "my automations" | N/A | `query_database` on `automations` table |
| "show me the content brief/outline" (existing report) | N/A | `query_database` on `content_struct_layout_headings` + `content_struct_layout_metadata` |
| "analyze competitors for keyword X" or "create/generate a content brief or outline" | `query_database` (SQL can only read outlines, not produce them) | `create_content_struct` (scrapes top SERP + competitor headings, async), then `generate_content_outline` (AI outline; needs provider + model — ask the user which) |
| "cluster these keywords" or "group my keywords by topic/SERP similarity" | `query_database` (read-only) or saved-keywords tools (wrong feature) | `create_serp_clustering_report` (async — poll `serp_clustering_reports.clustering_status`). To add keywords to an EXISTING report there is no add-keywords tool: `run_serp_clustering` with `keywords` + `distribute_keywords=true` (keeps existing clusters). To cut SERP cost on lists with word-order variants ("laravel horizon" / "horizon laravel"), pass `reuse_word_order_twins=true` on either tool (opt-in, default false; typically saves 6-16% of SERP cost) — tell the user the trade-off first: some keywords can land in a slightly different cluster, and word order occasionally changes intent. A twin that already has fresh SERP data keeps its own |
| "which pages are AI bots fetching?" | `get_organic_keywords` | Check `log_analysis_reports.bucket_schema_version` first. If ≥1, `query_database` on `log_file_analysis_page_activities WHERE ai_answer_hits + ai_assistant_hits > 0`. If =0, parse `bot_hits` JSON + JOIN `bot_categories` |
| "what questions are AI engines asking about my site?" | N/A | `query_database` on `log_file_analysis_ai_requests` grouping by `extracted_query`. Low counts are NORMAL if traffic is mostly ChatGPT-User / Claude-User — those bots strip prompt data |
| "is GPTBot / ClaudeBot / Google-Extended violating my robots.txt?" | `query_database` | `get_robots_compliance` — SQL cannot evaluate robots.txt rules, the matcher is Go-side |
| "how is AI traffic trending?" | N/A | `query_database` on `log_file_analysis_page_activities` summing `ai_answer_hits + ai_assistant_hits` by date (upgraded reports only) |

## Rule 3: When to Use API Tools

Use DataForSEO API action tools ONLY when:
- User asks about a **domain they don't track** (competitor research)
- User explicitly asks for **fresh/live data** from DataForSEO
- User wants **keyword suggestions** or **keyword metrics** for new keywords
- User wants **backlink data** for any domain
- User wants to **compare multiple domains** (bulk analysis)

## Rule 4: Export and Send

- `send_email` — send any email with SMTP. Check `smtp_credentials` table first
- Automations — use `create_automation` for recurring workflows (triggered by events)
- For one-time exports, generate the content and use `send_email` to deliver it

## Rule 5: Visualizing GMB Rank Tracker Grids

When the user asks to "draw", "render", "show on a map", or "visualize" GMB rank tracker grids or rankings, produce an HTML artifact using **Leaflet 1.9.4 from the unpkg CDN** that matches the in-app heatmap style. Do NOT use Google Maps (needs an API key, won't render in artifacts) or default Leaflet pins (wrong style — the app uses small colored circles).

**Data query** — use `query_database` to fetch grid points:
- Grid layout only (no rankings): `SELECT lat, lng FROM google_business_rank_tracker_markers WHERE google_business_rank_tracker_report_id = ? AND enabled = 1`
- Grid with rankings: join `google_business_rank_tracker_markers` with `google_business_rank_tracker_snapshot_items` on `(lat, lng)`, filtered by `place_id = report.place_id` and the chosen `snapshot_id`. For "best rank across all keywords" per grid point use `MIN(rank)` grouped by `(lat, lng)`. See the `google_business_rank_tracker_snapshot_items` schema annotation for the canonical avg_rank / SoLV math — do not invent your own.

**Pick the right marker size — this is the most common mistake:**

| Context | Marker style | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|
| **Full-page / standalone artifact** (default when the user asks "draw a map", "show me the grid", "visualize my rankings") | 32 px circle with the **rank number inside** + 2 px white border | Google Maps view in `GoogleBusinessRankTrackerMap.vue` (`createMarkerContentWithRank`, `frontend/src/helpers/googleMaps.js:81-250`) |
| **Compact / dashboard thumbnail** (only when the user says "thumbnail", "card", "widget", "compact preview", or marker count is ≥225 and labels would overlap) | 10 px solid colored dot, no text | Heatmap card in `GoogleBusinessRankTrackerReportHeatmap.vue` |

**Rendering recipe — full-page (default):**

1. Load Leaflet from CDN: `https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css` + `https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js`.
2. Init the map **interactive** with an OpenStreetMap tile layer so the user can see streets/neighborhoods:
   ```js
   const map = L.map(el)
   L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
     attribution: '&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors', maxZoom: 19
   }).addTo(map)
   ```
3. One marker per grid point with a labeled `L.divIcon` (text = rank, or `21+` when no rank):
   ```js
   L.marker([lat, lng], {
     icon: L.divIcon({
       className: 'gmb-rank-marker',
       html: `<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;
                          width:32px;height:32px;border-radius:9999px;
                          background:${color};color:#fff;font-weight:600;font-size:13px;
                          border:2px solid #fff;box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.35);">
                ${rank ?? '21+'}
              </div>`,
       iconSize: [32, 32],
       iconAnchor: [16, 16],
     }),
   }).addTo(map).bindTooltip(`Rank: ${rank ?? '21+'}`, {direction:'top'})
   ```
4. Auto-fit bounds: `map.fitBounds(bounds, {padding:[24,24], maxZoom:18})`.

**Rendering recipe — compact thumbnail (only when explicitly asked):**

- Same CDN load, but init map read-only and **omit the tile layer** for a transparent dot-only heatmap:
  ```js
  L.map(el, {dragging:false, zoomControl:false, scrollWheelZoom:false, doubleClickZoom:false,
             touchZoom:false, boxZoom:false, keyboard:false, attributionControl:false})
  ```
- Markers: `width:10px;height:10px;border-radius:9999px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15);` no text, `interactive:false`.
- Fit bounds with `padding:[12,12]` (use `[6,6]` when ≥121 markers).

**Color by rank — exact thresholds, do not improvise (both modes):**
- rank ≤ 3 → `#22c55e` (green)
- rank 4–10 → `#eab308` (yellow)
- rank > 10 (i.e. 11–20) OR no rank → `#ef4444` (red)

If the user wants extras (hover popups with rank/keyword/title, side-by-side per-keyword maps, dark mode), build on top of these recipes — but keep the marker dimensions, color thresholds, and Leaflet 1.9.4 CDN URL unchanged so the artifact stays visually consistent with the desktop app.
